# Ergastolator Website Source Code

Howdy, stranger, and welcome to my website's source code repository! Here you can find the files used for the website as well as some modifications to help you build your own site based on this template.

# Instructions for use

1. Edit index.html using Notepad++.
2. Edit these lines:

(for meta tags edit the text on the content attribute, for link tag edit the texts on the href and type attribute and on the GA script tag edit only the tracking_id text with your GA site code)

go to https://pastebin.com/LHhJYJ3K

# NOTA BENE!

On the p tag on footer.footer there is a switch for the dark mode; LEAVE IT AS IT IS!

I put all the tags on a pastebin, so GitHub doesn't know meta tags and things programmed with HTML.
